# soc-lab-wazuh
A virtual SOC lab using Wazuh to simulate real-world cybersecurity monitoring and attack detection.

---

## üìå Overview

This self-contained Security Operations Center (SOC) lab was built to gain practical experience in:

- Deploying a SIEM system using **Wazuh**
- Monitoring logs from **Windows, Linux, firewall**, and **web applications**
- Simulating real-world **cyberattacks** from Kali Linux
- Investigating alerts and writing custom detection rules

All components are virtualized using VMware and configured on an isolated network.

## üß± Lab Architecture

| Component          | Role                              | OS/Tool      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| Wazuh Server       | SIEM + log aggregation             | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Windows Endpoint   | Simulated client + agent logs      | Windows 10   |
| Ubuntu DVWA Server | Vulnerable web server + agent      | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| pfSense Firewall   | Log source (remote syslog)         | pfSense      |
| Kali Linux         | Attack simulation                  | Kali Linux   |

## üöÄ Attack Scenarios

| Scenario            | Description                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection       | Attacking DVWA input fields           |
| Brute Force Attack  | Login attempts using Hydra            |
| Reverse Shell       | Gaining shell access via DVWA         |

See detailed guides in [`/attack-scenarios`](attack-scenarios/)

## üîç Alerts & Detection

Wazuh alerts were triggered by simulated attacks and include:

- Failed login attempts
- SQL injection attempts
- Unauthorized shell access

Custom rules were also written. See [`logs-and-alerts/custom-rules.md`](logs-and-alerts/custom-rules.md)
